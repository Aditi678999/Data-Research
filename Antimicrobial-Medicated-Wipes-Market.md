As a result, antimicrobial wipes became a household staple, not only for personal hygiene but also for disinfecting surfaces. During this period, key drivers included:</p><ul> <li><strong>COVID-19 Pandemic:</strong> The onset of the pandemic in 2020 led to an unprecedented demand for sanitizing products, particularly wipes.

Demand will not only be influenced by hygiene concerns but also by technological, environmental, and regulatory factors.</p><ul> <li><strong>Environmental Sustainability:</strong> One of the most prominent shifts will be towards biodegradable and eco-friendly wipes.
